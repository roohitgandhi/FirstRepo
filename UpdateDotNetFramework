Backup Your Application: Before making any changes, it's always a good idea to back up your application and its associated files.

Install .NET Framework 4.8 SDK:

Review and Update Code:

After changing the target framework, review your code for any deprecated APIs or features that may have changed between 4.5.2 and 4.8.
Update any code that relies on deprecated APIs or features to use their modern equivalents.
Test Your Application:

Build your application and test it thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected with the updated framework version.
Pay special attention to any areas of your application that interact with external dependencies or system resources.
