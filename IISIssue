This error typically occurs when the application pool identity has incorrect credentials or lacks the necessary permissions to log on as a batch job. Here are a few steps you can take to resolve the issue:

1. **Verify Credentials**: Ensure that the username and password for the application pool identity are correct. If the password has changed recently, update it in IIS.
2. **Grant Logon Rights**: The identity may need "Log on as a batch job" rights. You can grant this by:
   - Opening **Local Security Policy** (`secpol.msc`).
   - Navigating to **Local Policies > User Rights Assignment**.
   - Adding the application pool identity to **Log on as a batch job**.
3. **Check Group Membership**: Ensure the identity is part of the **IIS_IUSRS** group or another appropriate group with necessary permissions.
4. **Reset the Application Pool**: Try restarting IIS or recycling the application pool after making changes.
5. **Use `aspnet_regiis -ga`**: If the identity is a custom account, you may need to grant it access using:
   ```
   aspnet_regiis -ga "DOMAIN\username"
   ```
6. **Check Event Logs**: Look at the Windows Event Viewer for more details on the failure.

If the issue persists, you might need to check domain policies that could be restricting the account. Let me know if you need more detailed guidance!
